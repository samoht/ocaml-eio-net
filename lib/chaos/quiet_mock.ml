(* A silent copy of Eio_mock's scheduler and clock.

   Copied from eio 1.6, lib_eio/mock/backend.ml and lib_eio/mock/clock.ml,
   trimmed to what Eio_net_chaos.check needs, with two changes:
   - moving the clock prints nothing. Eio_mock's clock calls [traceln] from
     the scheduler, where no fiber binding reaches, so a check built on it
     cannot keep stderr clean. A quiet mock clock belongs upstream; this copy
     stands in until then;
   - the scheduler stops instead of moving the clock past [limit], so a run
     that every fiber waits in reports as a hang, and one that keeps a timer
     going reports as a run past its time limit;
   - real time passes while a program polls: after [polls] turns at one
     instant in which every runnable fiber had just yielded, the clock moves
     on by 10 ms, or to the next timer if that comes first, as eio_posix
     fires a timer that is due between two rounds of its run queue. Once a
     fiber has yielded for 5 seconds, with no wait in between, the step is a
     tenth of how long it has, so that a program that polls for ever reaches
     the time limit.

   A loop run by the library reopens commit 495b8c2, which removed one along
   with the eio.mock dependency: hang detection and deterministic virtual time
   need a loop the check owns. This copy needs no eio.mock.
